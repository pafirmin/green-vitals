# Green Vitals

Green Vitals is a web-app that I created primarily as an exercise in CSS animation and the HTML5 canvas element.
The app takes a UK postcode as input, validated against the official UK government postcode RegEx, and uses this
to retrieve detailed location data from the postcode.io API. The relavent location data is then used to request 
data from the Natioanl Grid's carbon intensity API and Open Weather Map's air pollution service. The information 
from these responses is then rendered into suitable charts using the HTML5 canvas element
